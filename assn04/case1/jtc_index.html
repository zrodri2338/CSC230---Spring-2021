        <p>
          I hired Jedds to remove an old Sugar maple from a narrow yard. They
          did the job with no damage to my garage and cleaned it all up that
          same day. Great service.

        <p>
          Jedds Tree Care promptly came to examine a downed tree and provide an
          estimate for its removal. They did the job fast and at the lowest bid.
          I'll call them again without hesitation for future lawn and garden
          needs.

        <p>
          Their team took down five trees in one day and did an immaculate
          clean-up. They took extra care not to disturb my lawn and garden. I
          highly recommend their service.
